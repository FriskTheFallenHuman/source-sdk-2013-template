SDK Sample App MOTD

Welcome to the SDK Template!<br>

For Programmers:
Check out "sdk_shareddefs.h" Inside this header, you will find a number of defines which activate functionality. By default, all of these defines are commented out.

Features present in this template are:
 * Team System, complete with a team selection menu.<br>
 * Player Class System, based heavily on proven Day of Defeat: Source, and Team Fortress 2 code.
 - Simply define the classes in "sdk_shareddefs.cpp" and edit existing or create new script files in the scripts folder.
 * Prone and Sprinting functionality<br>
 * Updated scoreboard functionality for teams and including Orange Box's new community avatar support
 * and more!

For Artists:
 * There is new model sources for the player included in this sample.<br>
 * The sources for the sample map "sdk_teams_hdr" is also included; most tonemap controller inputs now function in multiplayer!<br>
